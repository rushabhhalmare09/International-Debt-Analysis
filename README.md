# International-Debt-Analysis

Poblem Statement: - 

  Governments, like individuals, may borrow money to manage their economies, finance budget deficits or capital projects, or meet the balance of payments   
  or cost of national emergencies. For example, infrastructure spending is one costly ingredient required for a country's citizens to lead comfortable  
   lives. The World Bank is the organization that provides debt to countries.

  In this project, we are going to analyze international debt data collected by The World Bank. The dataset contains information about the amount of debt   
  (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories.
